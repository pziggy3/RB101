Ensure the time difference is in the range of 0...MINUTES_PER_DAY by using the % operator (it computes the remainder of dividing the left side by the right side)
Use divmod to break the time difference down into hours and minutes
Format the results with Kernel#format. Each %02d produces a two-digit number with leading zeros as needed.
